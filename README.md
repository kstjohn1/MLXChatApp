The app defaults to localhost:8080, but you should be able to point it at any OpenAI API compatible server. I created it so I could more easily query my local MLX models.

Quick start:

pip install mlx
mlx_lm.server --model mlx-community/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B-bf16

Compile and run the app in xCode.
